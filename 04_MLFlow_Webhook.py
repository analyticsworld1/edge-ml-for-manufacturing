# MAGIC ###Creating MLflow Webhooks to enable automation
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC MLflow webhooks enable you to listen to Model Registry events, such as when a model version is created or when that version is transitioned into a production environment, to automatically trigger actions. These webhooks allow you to automate your MLOps processes and integrate your machine learning pipeline with other CI/CD tools such as Azure DevOps. In this scenario, we will trigger the Azure DevOps pipeline that creates and uploads the Docker image anytime a version of our ML Model is transitioned into the production stage.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC MLflow webhooks can be created through the Databricks REST API or using the Python library databricks-registry-webhooks. Here is the important section of Python code that creates the MLflow webhook to track when the “sensor_model” gets transitioned into production.
# COMMAND ----------
# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC To call the Databricks Job, we pass the Job ID we captured earlier to the JobSpec function. There are multiple Webhook events that can be configured such as when a new version of the ML model gets created (MODEL_VERSION_CREATED) or when a new ML model is registered in MLFlow registry (REGISTERED_MODEL_CREATED). For this example, we are configuring the Webhook to be triggered anytime a version of the ML model is transitioned into the production stage.
# COMMAND ----------
# MAGIC %pip install databricks-registry-webhooks git+https://github.com/databricks-academy/dbacademy@v1.0.13 git+https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/notebook-solution-companion@safe-print-html --quiet --disable-pip-version-check
# COMMAND ----------
# DBTITLE 1,Get configs such as model names that are consistent throughout this accelerator
# MAGIC %run ./config/notebook_config
# COMMAND ----------
# MAGIC %md In the blog, we asked you to follow these [steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/workflows/jobs/jobs) to create a Databricks Job and point that job to notebook 02. 
# MAGIC Here we automated this step with `NotebookSolutionCompanion` to ensure consistent job creation.
